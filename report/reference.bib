  abstract = {Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multi-layer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future. We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1. Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.}

We conclude that "for our Auckland, New Zealand, data‚Äú the gains in accuracy from including submarket variables in an ordinary least squares specification are greater than any benefits from using geostatistical or lattice methods.

We select hedonic methods that have been reported in the literature to perform relatively well in terms of ex-sample prediction accuracy. Because differences in performance may be due to differences in data, we compare the methods using a single data set. The estimation methods include simple OLS, a two-stage process incorporating nearest neighbors√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ residuals in the second stage, geostatistical, and trend surface models. These models take into account submarkets by adding dummy variables or by estimating separate equations for each submarket. Based on data for approximately 13,000 transactions from Louisville, Kentucky, we conclude that a geostatistical model with disaggregated submarket variables performs best.},

abstract = {Random Forest is a computationally efficient technique that can operate quickly over large datasets. It has been used in many recent research projects and real-world applications in diverse domains. However, the associated literature provides almost no directions about how many trees should be used to compose a Random Forest. The research reported here analyzes whether there is an optimal number of trees within a Random Forest, i.e., a threshold from which increasing the number of trees would bring no significant performance gain, and would only increase the computational cost. Our main conclusions are: as the number of trees grows, it does not always mean the performance of the forest is significantly better than previous forests (fewer trees), and doubling the number of trees is worthless. It is also possible to state there is a threshold beyond which there is no significant gain, unless a huge computational environment is available. In addition, it was found an experimental relationship for the AUC gain when doubling the number of trees in any forest. Furthermore, as the number of trees grows, the full set of attributes tend to be used within a Random Forest, which may not be interesting in the biomedical domain. Additionally, datasets‚Äô density-based metrics proposed here probably capture some aspects of the VC dimension on decision trees and low-density datasets may require large capacity machines whilst the opposite also seems to be true.},

abstract = {DNA micro-arrays now permit scientists to screen thousands of genes simultaneously and determine whether those genes are active, hyperactive or silent in normal or cancerous tissue. Because these newmicro-array devices generate bewildering amounts of raw data, new analytical methods must be developed to sort out whether cancer tissues have distinctive signatures of gene expression over normal tissues or other types of cancer tissues. In this paper, we address the problem of selection of a small subset of genes from broad patterns of gene expression data, recorded on DNA micro-arrays. Using available training examples from cancer and normal patients, we build a classifier suitable for genetic diagnosis, as well as drug discovery. Previous attempts to address this problem select genes with correlation techniques.We propose a newmethod of gene selection utilizing Support Vector Machine methods based on Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).We demonstrate experimentally that the genes selected by our techniques yield better classification performance and are biologically relevant to cancer. In contrast with the baseline method, our method eliminates gene redundancy automatically and yields better and more compact gene subsets. In patients with leukemia our method discovered 2 genes that yield zero leave- one-out error, while 64 genes are necessary for the baseline method to get the best result (one leave-one-out error). In the colon cancer database, using only 4 genes our method is 98\% accurate, while the baseline method is only 86\% accurate.},
